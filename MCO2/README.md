# NS3 Simulation (Pair Project)

## Description

The task was simply to build a mobile ad-hoc routing protocol using NS-3. We were given the choice to implement one of the three routing protocols to our liking which are:

- Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
- Optimized Link-State Routing (OSLR)
- Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV)

## Specification

- Data Flow: `messages`
- Traffic Pattern: `TCP`
- Simulation Time: `300s`
- Transmission Range: `25m`
- Protocol Stack: `TCP/IP`
- Medium: `WLAN 802.11`
- Packet Size: `512 bytes`
- Mobility Model: `Static and RandomWayPoint`
- Number of Nodes: `30 nodes (15 static, 15 mobile)`
